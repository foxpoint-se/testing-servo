## Notes

Is this the problem with wheel?
Seems so.
`sudo apt install python3-pip`

We definately need this. It has to do with not having this group by default on Ubuntu.
On Raspberry Pi it is already set up.
`sudo python gpio_udev_setup.py ubuntu gpio`

Could probably be good, but didn't seem to be necessary for permission problem.
`sudo apt install python-dev`
